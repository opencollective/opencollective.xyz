New web3 native branch for open collective

## Why

Current version of open collective only works with fiat currencies.
An increasing number of collectives start receiving funding with crypto and can't properly account for those contributions.

Collectives also need a way to issue their own token to reward non-financial contributions.

## Who is behind this?

- [Xavier Damman](https://linkedin.com/in/xavierdamman) (founder of Open Collective)
- [Leen Schelfhout](https://linkedin.com/in/leen-schelfhout) (cofounder and director of allforclimate.earth, an open collective host for climate)
- [Cuiki](https://linkedin.com/in/cuiki) (original designer of Open Collective)
- [Kris Decoodt](https://linkedin.com/in/krisdecoodt) (DAO wizard for Giveth, Gitcoin)

## What about the current version of Open Collective

To avoid any disruption, the current version has moved to a new non-profit controlled by existing fiscal hosts. This ensures its maintenance and continuity. Collectives don't have to touch crypto if they don't want to.
